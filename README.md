## 📚 Overview

This self-initiated project simulates a real-world data analysis scenario inspired by a business case study from the automotive industry (Bajaj). Using Microsoft Excel, I worked on analyzing sales performance, dealer operations, and product-level performance using raw transactional data. The objective was to derive actionable insights and practice using advanced Excel functions for data-driven decision-making.
